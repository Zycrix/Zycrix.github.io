          <h2>Rainydays</h2>
          <p>This was the first project at Noroff, the goal was to create an ecommerse site selling rain jackets with a target audience of 30 - 50 years old with an active lifestyle. The project first started with only html and css and later javascript was also added to make it fully functional on the front end. </p>

          <h2>Community science museum</h2>
          <p>This was the semester project for the first year. The goal of this project was to create a website for a science museum opening nearby that would be appealing to children and families with young children. The site also needed to be appealing to children without pandering them. </p>

          <h2>Tech Heaven</h2>
          <p>This site was made for my first year exam project. The goal for this project was to create a blog site using html, css and js and implement certain functions to the site like a carousel and js form validation. The blog also had to fetch all the posts from an api using the wp rest api as the back end. </p>
